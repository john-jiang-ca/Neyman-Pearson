\section*{\centering Abstract}
We propose a Modified Extended Neyman Pearson (MENP) framework which is suitable for spectrum sensing when there might be different types of primary signals. Our work generalizes existing Neyman Pearson (NP) test to multiple probability of false alarm constraints. This allows the cognitive radio wireless communication system to provide different levels of protection for various primary users.  
M-ROC surface, representing the relationship between the probability of detection and the constraints, is used to depict the performance of MENP testing.   

Using MENP framework, an energy based spectrum detector and a cyclostationary based spectrum detector, are developed to detect OFDM signals. These detectors are designed to have the largest probability of detection under any probability of false alarm constraints.  

Performance analyses were performed to study the M-ROC surface behavior for both detectors. We then evaluate the improvement of the probability of detection with respect to the increase of probability of false alarms.  
The performance analysis also confirms that the optimal decision rule of energy based spectrum detector can be derived in terms of the inverse CDF of Chi-Square distribution.
