This is the beta version of fancyhdr, a replacement for fancyheadings. 

There are no known bugs, and the only reason that this is not a real
release is that I want to make a real .dtx of it, including the minimal
documentation. The current documentation is in fancyhdr.tex, but this
contains much more material than the fancyhdr doc. When the fancyhdr.dtx is
ready, I will rename fancyhdr.tex into something like pagelay.tex to get it
more in line with the title (Page Layout in LaTeX).

fancyhdr is 99% compatible with fancyheadings. The only incompatibility is
that \headrulewidth and \footrulewidth and their \plain.. versions are no
longer length parameters, but normal macros (to be changed with
\renewcommand rather than \setlength).

Although all the other old fancyheadings commands continue to work you are
advised to use the new syntax as described in fancyhdr.tex, because this is
much easier to use in complicated cases. The old way of doing is no longer
described in the manual, except for the simplest use of \lhead etc.

In order to latex the documentation you need to install a copy of
tex-archive/macros/latex209/contrib/misc/boxedminipage.sty
