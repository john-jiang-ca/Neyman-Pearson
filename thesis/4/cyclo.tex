% cyclostationary based energy detection
\section{Cyclostationary Detection for multiple Primary Users}
\subsection{System Model}
Upon examination of energy detection, this section proposes a detector that exploits the empirical second-order-statistics of the received signal to distinguish spectrum hole under MENP framework. A typical detector based on second-order-statistics is cyclostationary detection, which  utilizes the auto-correlation property of the received signal to determine the channel status.
