\chapter{Application of MENP Framework in Spectrum Sensing and Simulation Results}
Upon examination of theoretical aspect of the MENP framework and the M-ROC, this thesis will now apply the new hypotheses testing framework to spectrum sensing for multiple primary users. We consider energy as well as cyclostationary based detectors to detect multiple primary signals. Performance analysis results, which illustrate the performance of both detectors, will be presented.
