\chapter{Application of MENP Framework in Spectrum Sensing and Simulation Results}
Upon examination of the theoretical part of MENP framework and M-ROC, this thesis will now apply the new hypotheses testing framework to application, which in our case is spectrum sensing for multiple primary users. We proposed energy based detector and cyclostationary based detector to detect multiple OFDM signals under AWGN channel. Performance analysis results, which illustrate the performance of both detector, will be presented.
