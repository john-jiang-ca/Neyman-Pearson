To run a program, all of the files in Table \ref{filelist} must be placed in the Matlab current work folder. These programs have been successfully run using Matlab 2013b and Matlab 2014a on Linux platform with 12 GB RAM.  
To generate ROC surface for Gaussian situation, run gaussian\_example.m. This can be done by running the following command in Matlab command line.
\\Matlab> gaussian\_example.m

The file loads configurations from init.txt file. When the computation finishes file output.mat stores the results and plotfigure.m excutes automatically to generate the ROC surface.


To generate MROC surface for general Gaussian situation, run gaussian\_general.m. This can be done by running the following command in Matlab command line.
\\Matlab> gaussian\_general.m

The file loads configurations from init.txt file. When the computation finishes file output.mat stores the results and plotfigure.m excutes automatically to generate the MROC surface.


To generate MROC surface for Gaussian distribution with equal variance, run gaussian\_equal\_var.m. This can be done by running the following command in Matlab command line.
\\Matlab> gaussian\_equal\_var.m

The file loads configurations from init.txt file. When the computation finishes file output.mat stores the results and plotfigure.m excutes automatically to generate the MROC surface.


To generate MROC surface for Chi-Square situation, run JAchisquare.m. This can be done by running the following command in Matlab command line.
\\Matlab> JAchisquare.m

The file loads configurations from init.txt file. When the computation finishes file output.mat stores the results and plotfigure.m excutes automatically to generate the MROC surface.

To generate MROC surface cyclostationary detection, run cyclo.m. This can be done by running the following command in Matlab command line.
\\Matlab> cyclo

The file loads configurations from init.txt file. When the computation finishes file PDFs.mat stores the PDF function, output.mat stores the MROC data  and plotfigure.m excutes automatically to generate the MROC surface.

The adjustable parameters for ENP (MENP) test are listed in table \ref{constantlist}.
