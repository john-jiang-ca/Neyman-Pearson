\chapter{Extended Neyman Pearson Test}

\newcommand{\bom}{\boldsymbol{\omega}}
This chapter will start by introducing the Extended Neyman Pearson Framework. A few properties concerning ENP test will be shown. The limitation of ENP framework will come after that. Following that is a section which detailedly present Modified Extended Neyman Pearson (MENP) Framework. The new scheme aims to achieve the largest probability of detection under any possible probability of false alarm constraints. Then an algorithm which aims at achieving the MENP parameters will be reviewed. Computer simulation results, which illustrate the performance of the algorithm, will be presented.
