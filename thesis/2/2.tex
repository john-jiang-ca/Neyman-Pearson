\chapter{Extended Neyman Pearson Test}

\newcommand{\bom}{\boldsymbol{\omega}}
This chapter starts by introducing the Extended Neyman Pearson Framework. Some properties concerning the ENP test are considered, as well as its limitation. Finally, the Modified Extended Neyman Pearson (MENP) framework is presented aiming to achieve the largest probability of detection under any possible probability of false alarm constraints. Finally an algorithm for calculating the MENP parameters is considered, and  computer simulation results, which illustrate the performance of the algorithm, are presented.
