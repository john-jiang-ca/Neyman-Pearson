\chapter{Extended Neyman Pearson Test}

\newcommand{\bom}{\boldsymbol{\omega}}
This chapter starts by introducing the Extended Neyman Pearson Framework. Some properties concerning ENP test are concluded, as well as its limitation. Then the Modified Extended Neyman Pearson (MENP) framework is presented aiming to achieve the largest probability of detection under any possible probability of false alarm constraints. Then an algorithm which aims at achieving the MENP parameters is reviewed, and  computer simulation results, which illustrate the performance of the algorithm, are presented.
